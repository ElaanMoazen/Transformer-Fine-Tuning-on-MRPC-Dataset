# Transformer-Fine-Tuning-on-MRPC-Dataset
Fine-tune a transformer model on the MRPC dataset for transfer learning. Includes dataset loading, model compilation, training, and evaluation. 

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for fine-tuning a transformer model on the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) dataset. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the process of transfer learning using a transformer-based architecture. The steps include loading the dataset, preparing the model, compiling it, training, and evaluating the results.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0) or PyTorch (>=1.0)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/transformer-fine-tuning-mrpc.git
cd transformer-fine-tuning-mrpc
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Steps

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Download the MRPC dataset and preprocess it according to your requirements.

2. **Model Loading**: Choose a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT, GPT, etc.) and load it using the appropriate library.

3. **Model Compilation**: Customize the loaded model for the specific task of paraphrase detection using appropriate layers and configurations.

4. **Training**: Fine-tune the compiled model on the MRPC dataset. Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, etc., for optimal performance.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set or using cross-validation. Measure performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have sufficient computational resources for training, especially if using GPU or TPU acceleration.
- Experiment with different transformer architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies to improve model performance.
- Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific requirements or use case.
